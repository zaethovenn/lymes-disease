Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for the Final Project.

## Information

Each of the deliverables for this project (i.e., proposal, progress report, final report) have separate directories in the ```writing/``` directory. You may use your repository as your group chooses, however all the submission files must be placed in their correct directory of the ```writing/``` directory.

See assignment for other details.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review the chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.
