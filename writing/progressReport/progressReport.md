We have continued to make progress on our project over the past week. We are happy with
the progress we have made so far. Some of this progress includes researching what exactly
Lyme disease is, as well as how it is caused. Using our tool, we have also gathered information
on what relation/similarities it has to other diseases. The information we have gathered so far
we have saved to a google doc that we all have access to, which allows us to add and format
information much easier compared to if we were actively adding the information through github, as
our method removes the possibility of merge issues. We have continued to utilize the sources
that we outlined in our project proposal, as these sources have been very helpful to us. As we continue to make more progress, we plan to branch out and utilize other primary and secondary
sources that can support our project.

As we continue to add information to the document for our final report, we will begin to plan for
the final presentation that we will be giving on our topic. We plan to have this presentation cover the highlights of our project in order to be informative while also being considerate of time.

So far, we have not been faced with any challenges while working on this project, as Lyme disease
is a well known disease, meaning there are many sources of information on this topic at our disposal.
