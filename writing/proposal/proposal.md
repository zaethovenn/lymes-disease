# Proposal Document:

The research question we would like to focus this project on is what is Lyme disease, how is it caused, and what relation, if any, does it have to other diseases?

Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that causes various symptoms such as rash, joint pain, and weakness. We are interested in this topic because this is a very common disease that we
as a group do not know much about, thus we believe this is a good opportunity to better understand Lyme disease and how it may relate to other diseases. A majority of our project
would be based upon the tool we discovered called Laverne. Laverne is a tool available online through Novus Biologicals that helps "facilitate scientific exploration of related genes, diseases and pathways based on co-citations." This tool will be able to show genes, pathways, and diseases that are related to Lyme disease. Therefore, this tool will be used as a guide that will ultimately assist us in answering our research question.

In terms of supporting literature, our first article is a review of Lyme disease that is available through the NCBI. This article elaborates on what Lyme disease is, what causes it, and how it is diagnosed. Our second article, titled The Emergence of Lyme Disease, is available through JCI and elaborates on the spread of Lyme disease since its discovery in the late 20th century. Our third article is titled "Treatment of Early Lyme Disease." This article elaborates on the most efficient and successful ways to treat the disease.

Overall, we believe that our tool, along with our supporting literature, gives us enough resources to research and answer our proposed research question.
