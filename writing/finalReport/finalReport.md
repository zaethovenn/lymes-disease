## Motivation

In our first couple of classes, one of our readings was about modifying
genetic information in a kind of mouse so that we can use them to combat
lyme disease. It was the beginning of our adventure with bioinformatics
this semester, and we thought: what better way to end the class than
to revisit the very first thing we encountered and looked into it from
a different angle. Lyme disease is one of the more overlooked diseases,
where the effects are not lethal nor detrimental to our everyday
lives. However, it has an incredibly high spreading potential, and could
affect a large percentage of the population. Leaving such a disease
unattended would be very careless, and while it might be impractical to
aim for the complete disappearance of  the Lyme viruses, it is however
well within our reach to study the behavior of this virus and look for
ways in which we could combat this disease or stop its spread more
effectively and efficiently.

## Background on Lyme Disease

Since its discovery roughly 50 years ago, Lyme disease has continued
to spread throughout North America and Europe. The Lyme disease agent,
“Borrelia burgdorferi, causes infection by migration through tissues,
adhesion to host cells, and evasion of immune clearance”(Steere).
Towards the end of the 20th century, Lyme disease was recognized as
an emerging infection and is now the most commonly reported
arthropod-borne illness in the US and Europe according to Steere.

Lyme disease was recognized as a different illness before 1976. In 1975,
a woman from Lyme, Connecticut, called attention to a group of children
who were thought to have rheumatoid arthritis. Soon after, Yale researchers
discovered that “Lyme arthritis was a late manifestation of an apparently
tick-transmitted, multisystem disease, of which manifestations had been
recognized previously in Europe and America “(Steere). Years later, a
previously unidentified bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi was discovered
in ticks. It was then discovered that this bacteria and the Lyme disease
patients’ immune responses were linked conclusively, thus providing the
source of the infection.

Since its discovery, Borrelia burgdorferi has been subdivided into multiple
species, which include three that cause infection among humans. Although
all three species are found in Europe, “most of the disease there is due
to Borrelia afzelii, or Borrelia garinii, and only these two species seem
to be responsible for the illness in Asia” (Steere). Table 1, shown below,
elaborates on the various types of subdivisions of Borrelia burgdorferi,
as well as where they are primarily located at.

Over the past 40 years, Lyme disease has continued to spread across the
northern United States. At first it was centered around coastal areas,
but has since spread to suburban areas such as New York and Boston. Although
the disease has become more prevalent in North America, Europe still suffers
from the most reported cases, with the most affected countries being
Germany, Austria, Slovenia, and Sweden (Steere). In Austria and Slovenia,
cases reach up to 120-130 per 100,000 residents (Biesiada).

As mentioned previously, Lyme disease is contracted by humans through tick
bite. Ticks typically feed during each of the three stages of their life
cycle, with these times being late spring, late summer, and early fall.
Although ticks may attach to humans during any of the three stages,
transmission typically happens while the tick is in its nymph stage. This
is because this stage of the tick life cycle “has a peak period of questing
in the weeks surrounding the summer solstice” (Steere). Found below is a
diagram that displays the different stages of ticks as well as when they
transmit to humans and other animals.

Lyme disease is diagnosed in a patient who had been recently exposed to
ticks who also shows the symptoms that are typically associated with the
disease, which affect the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, as well as
the skin. In order to have Lyme disease, the tick must be attached for at
least 24 hours for an infection to result. There are two stages of the
disease, early and late. During the early stage, which is 3 to 30 days
after the tick bite, the patient may experience symptoms such as fever,
chills, rashes, headaches, and fatigue. During the late stage, which is
typically defined as over a month after the tick bite, the patient may
experience symptoms such as severe headaches, stiffness of neck, joint
pain/swelling, and nerve pain. Although these symptoms sound severe, it
can be treated. People treated with appropriate antibiotics in the early
stage of the illness typically recover very quickly. According to the CDC,
“early diagnosis and proper antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease can help
prevent late Lyme disease” (Lyme Disease Treatment).

## Tool

The tool that would help us in understanding more about Lyme disease is
called Laverne. Developed by Novus Biological, LLC - a company based in
Centennial, Colorado that develops, licenses, and markets research materials
for the scientific market. Laverne is a “virtual research assistant,
librarian, and data cruncher” (Novus Biological). It will allow us to
browse unbiased, bioinformatics data related to our gene, pathway, or
disease of interest. In our case, that would be the Lyme Borreliosis.
Laverne can also then provide an understanding of the biological
neighborhoods in our research space. It can look further into the existing
literature that might provide useful information on the different
aspects of the topic at hand, whether that will be on its genes,
pathways, or similarities it shares with other diseases. In other words,
it operates somewhat like a search engine, giving us the data that we
need to conduct further research.  The tool, Laverne, is very interesting
due to the makeup and flow of itself. At the centerpiece of the tool
there is a pink circle that when clicked takes you to a search results
page for lyme disease with instances of lyme disease in recorded hosts.
These values are important because you can compare the results of said
search inorder to see if lyme disease affects various hosts differently.

To further explore Laverne, we can go back to the main page and analyze the
10 extensions off of the pink centerpiece. The first most center extension
is labeled protein and if you were to click on the document symbol under t
he extension it will take you to a pop out tab with 413 different entries
of lyme disease and protein related articles/ journal entries. This one
extension alone expands our research at ease due to all of the 400 plus
entries regarding just protein and lyme disease information. If we were
to go back to the original home page we could do the same thing with another
extension. For example, the next extension is labeled Flagellin and if we
were to click on it’s document symbol directly under the name; we are taken
to another pop out. This pop out page shows us a result of 398 different
entries on lyme disease and Flagellin. All of this easily accessible
information on various parts of lyme disease will make any bioinformatics
research a lot easier. Having all of this information in one place makes
it very convenient for researchers who are diving deeply into Lyme
disease. Returning to the home page again we can see that the rest
of the extensions are labeled CSF, TNF, IFNG, PROTEIN C, C6,  IL6,
PLAB, and LD. What is very interesting to me is that the PLAB
extension is the only one with a very tiny blue circle rather than a
larger blue circle. We do not seem to see the purpose for it while
exploring the tool and its functionality. What makes this tool
extraordinary is that it gives us access to 1000+ articles related
all to Lyme disease and its many smaller pieces. What was super
interesting to us was that in the tool it states, “We have 2574 products
for the study of Lyme Disease that can be applied to Western Blot,
Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence, Flow Cytometry,
Immunohistochemistry from our catalog of antibodies and ELISA kits.”
This means that the data collected and put into Laverne is capable
of being applied to many different chemistry/bio fields and can
greatly affect what we know currently about Lyme disease. If you
were to scroll down from the Laverne tool and look at the related
sections it also shows a bunch of useful links to more research regarding
Lyme disease. In the first drop down it holds related genes with a bullet
list of all of the related genes lyme disease has been researched
against. For example a couple are listed as, CSF2, LAMC2, TNF … etc.
The next related column is relating to the pathways that Lyme disease
has been linked to. Another few links in this related pathways
column regards “pathogenesis, Immune Response, Virulence... etc.”
Also there is a column on the related diseases that we believe is very
important because it helps broaden our understanding of Lyme disease
as compared to other diseases. Some of the other diseases are
“Borrelia infections, Erythema, and Arthritis. There are many more
diseases linked to Lyme disease as well. The final related column
deals with related PTMS (Post Translational Modifications) like
Phosphorylation, Glycosylation, and Methylation. The last bit of
information that the Laverne tool produces is the alternate names
for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is also known as
“Lyme Neuroborreliosis, Neuroborreliosis, Bannwarth Syndrome
(disorder),Neurological Lyme disease, Lyme disease (disorder),
Bannwarth's syndrome, Lyme Borreliosis” (“How to Use Laverne, the
Novus Bioinformatics Tool.”). We found this very informative
because knowing all of the names referencing Lyme disease can
help us further understand more of the related articles and journal
entries that deal with Lyme disease under an alias. The Laverne tool is very
useful on how it can produce informative journal entries and useful information
on Lyme disease.

## Conclusion

Through this research, we have gotten the chance to learn more about Lyme disease
as well as how to use a bioinformatics tool. It has been an amazing experience
learning about implementations of technology into the field of biology, as well
as exploring how much of an impact they made on our daily lives. Our hope is
that through this research project, we will help bring awareness to Lyme
disease, a disease that despite being common, is usually overlooked. We also
hope that the information about Laverne will help other researchers in the
field on their search for answers to questions in the field of
bioinformatics, a vast mysterious land that awaits discovery.
